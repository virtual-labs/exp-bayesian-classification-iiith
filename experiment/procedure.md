**Stage 1:**

 1. Lauch the experiment and clear the pane. Assign differnt means and covariances for each of the classes and observe the resulting densities. Use the mark-all button to observe the decision boundaries.

 2. Note down your observations on the relationship between the decision boundaries and the density functions.

**Stage 2:**

 1. Repeat the above procedure for different values of prior probabilities.

 2. Observe the change in the scaled density functions and decision boundaries

 3. Note down your observations regarding the change of decision boundaries

**Stage 3:**

Generate the following types of decision boundaries by varying the means and covariance matrices.

  1. Straight line

  2. Parallel Straight lines
 
  3. Concentric circles
  4. Parabola
  5. Hyperbola
  6. Four Quadrants

Explain why these shapes are generated in each case.
