### Understanding Classification Approaches

#### Discriminative vs Generative Classifiers
1. **Discriminative Classifiers** (e.g., Linear Perceptrons)
   - Learn decision boundaries directly
   - Effective for well-separated classes
   - Focus on class separation
   - Simpler to implement

2. **Generative Classifiers** (Bayesian Approach)
   - Model each class as a random vector
   - Use probability distributions/density functions
   - Consider class likelihoods
   - More flexible in handling complex data

### Bayesian Classification
The experiment focuses on understanding how Bayesian classification:
- Computes class probabilities using Bayes' rule
- Combines prior knowledge with observed evidence
- Makes decisions based on posterior probabilities
- Handles uncertainty in classification

### Key Concepts
- Prior probabilities
- Likelihood functions
- Posterior probabilities
- Decision boundaries
- Class density functions
